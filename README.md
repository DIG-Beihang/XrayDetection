### 2）Real-time Problem

<p>The defect detection methods based on deep learning include three main links in industrial applications: <b>data annotation</b>, <b>model training</b>, and <b>model inference</b>. Real-time in actual industrial applications pays more attention to model inference. At present, most defect detection methods are concentrated in the accuracy of classification or recognition, little attention is paid to the efficiency of model inference. There are many methods for accelerating the model, such as model weighting and model pruning. In addition, although the existing deep learning model uses GPU as a general-purpose computing unit(GPGPU), with the development of technology, it is believed that FPGA will become an attractive alternative.</p>

## 2. Common Datasets for Industrial Surface Defect Detection

### 1）Steel Surface: NEU-CLS

NEU-CLS can be used for classification and positioning tasks.

<div align=center><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200927223042720.png"></div>

<p>The surface defect dataset released by Northeastern University (NEU) collects six typical surface defects of hot-rolled steel strips, namely rolling scale (RS), plaque (Pa), cracking (Cr), pitting surface (PS), inclusions (In) and scratches (Sc). The dataset includes 1,800 grayscale images, six different types of typical surface defects each of which contains 300 samples. For defect detection tasks, the dataset provides annotations that indicate the category and location of the defect in each image. For each defect, the yellow box is the border indicating its location, and the green label is the category score.</p>

### Kaggle - Severstal: Steel Defect Detection

<img align="right" alt="Severstal: Steel Defect Detection" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29084184/119592872-ddcc3f00-be0b-11eb-9d2e-6b1bc9216c89.png" width="150" title="Severstal: Steel Defect Detection">

Severstal is leading the charge in efficient steel mining and production. They believe the future of metallurgy requires development across the economic, ecological, and social aspects of the industry—and they take corporate responsibility seriously. The company recently created the country’s largest industrial data lake, with petabytes of data that were previously discarded. Severstal is now looking to machine learning to improve automation, increase efficiency, and maintain high quality in their production.

### 2）Solar Panels: elpv-dataset

<p>A dataset of functional and defective solar cells extracted from EL images of solar modules.</p>

- 🔗 link：https://github.com/zae-bayern/elpv-dataset


<div align=center><img src="https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20200927192329402.png"></div>
<br>

The dataset contains 2,624 samples of 300x300 pixels 8-bit grayscale images of functional and defective solar cells with varying degree of degradations extracted from 44 different solar modules. The defects in the annotated images are either of intrinsic or extrinsic type and are known to reduce the power efficiency of solar modules.

All images are normalized with respect to size and perspective. Additionally, any distortion induced by the camera lens used to capture the EL images was eliminated prior to solar cell extraction.

### 3）Metal Surface: KolektorSDD

The dataset is constructed from images of defected electrical commutators that were provided and annotated by Kolektor Group. Specifically, microscopic fractions or cracks were observed on the surface of the plastic embedding in electrical commutators. The surface area of each commutator was captured in eight non-overlapping images. The images were captured in a controlled environment.

- Download Link：https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=HSzHC1ltHvt1hSJh_IY4Jg (password：``1zlb``)


The dataset consists of:

- 50 physical items (defected electrical commutators)
- 8 surfaces per item
- Altogether 399 images:<br>
-- 52 images of visible defect<br>
-- 347 images without any defect
- Original images of sizes:<br>
-- width: 500 px<br>
-- height: from 1240 to 1270 px
- For training and evaluation images should be resized to 512 x 1408 px

For each item the defect is only visible in at least one image, while two items have defects on two images, which means there were 52 images where the defects are visible. The remaining 347 images serve as negative examples with non-defective surfaces.

This dataset consists of 245 4096x256 pixel images with seven different fabric structures. There are 140 non-defect images in the dataset, 20 of each type of fabric. In addition, there are 105 images of different types of fabric defects (12 types) common in the textile industry. The image size allows users to use different window sizes, thereby the number of samples can be increased. The online dataset also contains segmentation masks of all defective images, so that white pixels represent defective areas and the remaining pixels are black.

### 6）Fabric Defect Dataset (Tianchi)

In the actual production process of cloth, due to the influence of various factors, defects such as stains, holes, lint, etc. will occur. In order to ensure the quality of the product, the cloth needs to be inspected for defects. 

Fabric defect inspection is an important part of the textile industry's production and quality management. At present, manual inspection is susceptible to subjective factors and lacks consistency, and inspection personnel working for a long time under strong light has a great impact on vision. Due to the wide variety of fabric defects, various morphological changes, and the difficulty of observation and recognition, the intelligent detection of fabric defects has been a technical bottleneck that has plagued the industry for many years. 

This dataset covers all kinds of important defects in fabrics in the textile industry, and each picture contains one or more defects. The data includes two types of plain cloth and patterned cloth. Among them, about 8000 pieces of plain cloth data are used for preliminary matches, and about 12,000 pieces of patterned cloth data are used for semi-finals.

### 7）Aluminium Profile Surface Defect Dataset（Tianchi）

- 🔗 Download Link：https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231682/information

Due to the influence of various factors in the actual production process of aluminum profile, the surface of the aluminum profile will have cracks, peeling, scratches and other defects, which will seriously affect the quality of the aluminum profile. To ensure product quality, manual visual inspection is required. However, the surface of the aluminum profile itself contains textures, which are not highly distinguishable from defects. 

Traditional manual visual inspection methods have many shortcomings, which are very laborious, cannot accurately judge surface defects in time, and have difficult to control the efficiency of quality inspection. In recent years, deep learning has made rapid progress in image recognition and other fields. Aluminum profile manufacturers are eager to use the latest AI technology to innovate the existing quality inspection process, automatically complete quality inspection tasks, reduce the incidence of missed inspections, and improve product quality. AI technology, especially deep learning, makes aluminum profile product production managers completely free from the inability to fully grasp the state of product surface quality. 

In the dataset of the competition, there are 10,000 pieces of monitoring image data from aluminum profiles with defects in actual production, and each image contains one or more defects. The sample image for machine learning will clearly identify the type of defect contained in the image.

The idea of collecting this data set originally came from reading an article on surface defect detection by SFXiang of "AI算法修炼营(AI_SuanFa)", which prompted me to organize a more comprehensive data set. The collection of papers comes from a CSDNer named "庆志的小徒弟". These papers are only until November 19, and I will continue to be improved after that. <strong>Hopefully, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Charmve/Surface-Defect-Detection/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">CONTRIBUTE</a>.</strong></p>
