## 1. Released Datasets for Xray Object Detection

### 1ï¼‰OPIXray: Occluded Prohibited Items X-ray
Occluded Prohibited Items X-ray(OPIXray) is the first high-quality object detection dataset for security inspection.

The backgrounds of all samples in OPIXray are scanned by the security inspection machine and each prohibited item is annotated manually by professional inspectors from the international airport, which localized by a box-level annotation with a bounding box. 

* Download Link: If you want to access the dataset, please sign the <a href="https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/XrayDetection/blob/master/Commitment.pdf">PDF</a> file and send it to cvresearcher@163.com. After receiving your request, we will rely with the download link soon.

OPIXray dataset consists of:

* Altogether 8885 X-ray images
* 5 categories of cutters: 
  - Folding Knife: 1993 images
  - Straight Knifeï¼š1044 images
  - Scissorï¼š1863 images
  - Utility Knifeï¼š1978 images
  - Multi-tool Knifeï¼š2042 images

* All images are stored in JPG format with the resolution of 1225*954. 
<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/XrayDetection/blob/main/Imgs/opi1.png"></div>

The dataset is partitioned into a training set and a testing set, with the former containing 80% of the images (7109) and the latter containing 20% (1776), where the ratio is about 4 : 1. In order to study the impact brought by object occlusion levels, the testing set was divided into three subsets named as Occlusion Level 1 (OL1), Occlusion Level 2 (OL2) and Occlusion Level 3 (OL3), where the number indicates occlusion level of prohibited items in images.

### 2ï¼‰HiXray: High-quality X-ray
HiXray is a large high-quality dataset for prohibited items detection in X-ray images, which is gathered from real-world daily security inspections in an international airport. Each instance is manually annotated by professional inspectors from the international airport, guaranteeing the accurate annotations.

* Download Link: If you want to access the dataset, please sign the <a href="https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/XrayDetection/blob/master/Commitment.pdf">PDF</a> file and send it to cvresearcher@163.com. After receiving your request, we will rely with the download link soon.

HiXray dataset consists of:

* Altogether 45,364 X-ray images
* 8 categories of 102,928 common prohibited items:
  - Portable Charger 1 (PO1): 12421 prohibited items
  - Portable Charger 2 (PO2): 7788 prohibited items
  - Water(WA): 3092 prohibited items
  - Laptop(LA): 10042 prohibited items
  - Mobile phone(MP): 53835 prohibited items
  - Tablet(TA): 4918 prohibited items
  - Cosmetic(CO): 9949 prohibited items
  - Nonmetallic Lighter(NL): 883 prohibited items

* All images are stored in JPG format with a 1200*900 resolution,  resolution, averagely. 
* The maximum resolution of samples can reach 2000*1040

<div align=center><img src="./Imgs/hi.png"></div>

The dataset is partitioned into a training set and a testing set, where the ratio is about 4 : 1.

### 3ï¼‰EDS: Endogenous Domain Shift
Endogenous Domain Shift (EDS) dataset is the first endogenous domain shift benchmark, by selecting a typical scenario, X-ray security inspection. Due to the differences in intrinsic mechanisms or hardware components of the imaging systems of different types of X-ray machines, there are subtle perturbations in X-ray images generated by different X-ray machines, which cause the endogenous shift. 

* Download Link: If you want to access the dataset, please sign the <a href="https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/XrayDetection/blob/master/Commitment.pdf">PDF</a> file and send it to cvresearcher@163.com. After receiving your request, we will rely with the download link soon.

EDS dataset consists of:

* 3 different domains
* Altogether 14,219 X-ray images
<div align=center><img src="./Imgs/eds.png"></div>

* 10 categories of 31,654 common prohibited items. It is guaranteed that the instances in each category is no less than 1000, which is sufficient for the evaluation.
<div align=center><img src="./Imgs/eds2.png"></div>

Three X-ray security inspection machines from different manufactures and with different serving time are exploited to generate three domains of images. We randomly put the objects in preprepared package to generate images. After sending the package to the security inspection machine, the machine will completely cut out the package by detecting the blank.

### 4ï¼‰X-ray FSOD
X-ray FSOD dataset is the first weak-feature FSOD evaluation benchmark by selecting the typical scenario, X-ray security inspection. All the samples of X-ray FSOD dataset are generated by X-ray machines, where the texture information of prohibited items is almost eliminated by X-ray.


* Download Link: If you want to access the dataset, please sign the <a href="https://github.com/DIG-Beihang/XrayDetection/blob/master/Commitment.pdf">PDF</a> file and send it to cvresearcher@163.com. After receiving your request, we will rely with the download link soon.

X-ray FSOD dataset consists of:

* Altogether 12,333 X-ray images
* 20 categories of 41,704 common prohibited items, where 16 categories are selected from three dataset, including 5 from OPIXray, 5 from HiXray and 4 from EDS Dataset, and other 6 categories are newly contributed:
  - **OPIXray**:
  - Folding (FO): 12421 prohibited items
  - Straight (PO2): 7788 prohibited items
  - Scissor(WA): 3092 prohibited items
  - Utility(LA): 10042 prohibited items
  - Multi-tool(MP): 53835 prohibited items
  - **HiXray**:
  - Laptop(TA): 4918 prohibited items
  - Lighter(CO): 9949 prohibited items
  - Charger1(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Charger2(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Phone(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - **EDS**:
  - Plastic Bottle(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Glass Bottle(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Pressure(NL): 883 prohibited items

  - **New**:
  - Battery(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Iron Shoe(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Metal Can(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Metal Cup(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Nail Clipper(NL): 883 prohibited items
  - Alcohol(NL): 883 prohibited items

The researchers exploit the X-ray security inspection machine and randomly put the objects in pre-prepared package to generate images. For other objects in the luggage, The researchers aim to simulate the real-world traveling luggage by putting some common items e.g., clothes, shoes. After sending the package to the security inspection machine, the machine will completely cut out the package by detecting the blank.
